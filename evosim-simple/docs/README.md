Educational Survival Simulation Using Evolutionary Algorithms
üìñ Project Overview

This project is a small-scale educational simulation designed to demonstrate how evolutionary algorithms can optimize the decision-making processes in virtual animals. It uses a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as the "brain" for each animal, allowing them to learn and adapt to their environment over several generations. The primary goal is to serve as a teaching tool for students to visualize and understand core concepts of adaptation, survival, and evolutionary learning in the context of Artificial Intelligence.

This project is presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Caloocan City.
‚ú® Key Features

    Simple Neural Network: Each animal's decisions are controlled by a minimal MLP with 2 inputs (Hunger, Thirst), 1 hidden layer, and 4 outputs (Move, Eat, Drink, Rest).

    Evolutionary Learning: An evolutionary algorithm featuring selection and mutation is implemented to improve animal behaviors across 3-5 generations.

    2D Simulation World: A 20x20 grid-based environment contains limited resources like food and water that animals must find to survive.

    Dynamic Challenge Events: The simulation can introduce events like droughts and storms to test the adaptability of the animal population.

    Interactive Simulation: Students can modify initial conditions such as population size and resource availability to observe different evolutionary outcomes.

    Data Visualization: The simulation presents key survival data, such as the number of survivors and average fitness scores, to help students analyze the learning process.

üéØ Project Objectives
General Objective

To create an educational simulation that clearly demonstrates how a Multi-Layer Perceptron, guided by evolutionary algorithms, can model animal survival and adaptation, making complex AI concepts accessible to students.
Specific Objectives

    Design a simple MLP to process Hunger and Thirst inputs and decide on one of four actions: Move, Eat, Drink, or Rest.

    Implement an evolutionary algorithm (selection + mutation) to enhance survival behaviors over successive generations.

    Simulate a 2D grid environment with finite food and water resources.

    Introduce challenge events (Drought, Storm) to test the population's adaptability.

    Provide an interactive setup for students to adjust initial simulation parameters.

    Present survival data to help students analyze the outcomes of the evolutionary process.

üõ†Ô∏è Scope and Limitations
Scope

    MLP Model: Minimal neural network (2 inputs, 1 hidden layer, 4 outputs).

    Evolutionary Algorithm: Simple selection and mutation process over 3-5 generations.

    Environment: 20x20 grid world with food and water.

    Events: Two predefined events (drought and storm).

    User Interaction: Ability to set initial animal count and food/water availability.

    Output: Survival statistics and basic charts/logs.

Limitations

    The neural network is intentionally shallow to prioritize understanding over complexity.

    Only two survival needs (Hunger, Thirst) are modeled.

    The simulation is limited to two types of environmental events.

    Visuals are basic (grid with symbols) and do not include complex animations.

    The simulation runs for a limited number of generations to ensure short runtimes.
